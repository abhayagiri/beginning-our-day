\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This book would not have been possible without the contributions of many
people.

Pamela Kirby initiated the project when she asked to place a recorder in
front of one of the senior monks during a morning reflection.

Matthew Grad, Jeff Miller, Ila Lewis, Pamela Kirby, Ray Peterson, and
Laurent Palmatier were the main substantive editors of the material,
enduring the long and difficult process of editing the transcripts into
compact and well-written teachings.

Ruby Grad did most of the copy editing. Sumi Shin designed the cover.
And David Burrowes Dee Cope, Josh Himmelfarb, Evan Hirsch, and Jeanie
Daskais had a hand in editing, proofreading, or transcribing.

Over several years, Khemako Bhikkhu recorded the senior monks
reflections on a daily basis. Kovilo Bhikkhu and Pesalo Bhikkhu provided
corrections and suggestions on an early draft of the book. Suhajjo
Bhikkhu generously dedicated a significant amount of time on the overall
book design and typesetting of the text.

There are many others who have helped directly and indirectly to make
this book a reality. The extended community of Abhayagiri, both lay and
monastic, provided the essential support and resources for this project
from beginning to end.\\
