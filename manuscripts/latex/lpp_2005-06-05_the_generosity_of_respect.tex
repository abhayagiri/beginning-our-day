\mychapter{The Generosity of Respect}{Luang Por Pasanno}{June 2005}

When we are working together and interacting with each other, it's 
important for each of us in the community to have mutual respect for 
one another and to recognize that everybody is here because they have 
the intention to do something good, something wholesome. On the level 
of personality, it's easy to exercise our critical faculties---we're 
pretty adept at that. Especially when we live together over long 
periods of time, we get to know each others' quirks rather intimately. 
It doesn't take much intelligence or wisdom to pick up on somebody's 
quirks. It takes significantly more wisdom to attend to our own 
wholesome intentions and to honor and respect the wholesome intentions 
of other people. This doesn't mean that suddenly people are no longer 
irritating. But it does mean that we have a lot more space to deal with 
and support each other because we sense the opportunity for 
generosity---being generous by offering each other a sense of respect. 
We usually think of generosity in material terms, but it also means 
giving each other respect, space, encouragement, and support for our 
spiritual endeavors. That is a significant act of generosity that helps 
to transform the heart.
