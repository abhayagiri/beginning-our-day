\mychapter{It's Not a Sure Thing}{Luang Por Pasanno}{June 2012}

It is the commemoration of Ajahn Chah's birthday today. One of the 
constant refrains in his teaching and training is the recollection of 
the Thai phrase, \emph{mynair}---unsure, uncertain, not a sure thing. 
We can develop the ability to hold experience in this space of not sure 
and uncertainty. Often the mind inclines to some sort of story: 
\emph{It's going to be just like this; this is going to be really 
wonderful; that is going to be great.} But the challenge is remembering 
that it's just a story, it's not a sure thing. The mind can also buy 
into: \emph{It's going to be awful; it's going to be dreadful; how am I 
going to bear with this?} What can help us with this is thinking: 
\emph{it's not a sure thing.} We develop the ability to hold experience 
within the framework of mindfulness, reflection, investigation, and 
discernment and openly acknowledge that we're not sure what it's going 
to be like. When we hold experience in this way, we find that 
everything is bearable, everything is quite all right---we are creating 
a framework of Dhamma rather than a framework of our own reactions and 
habits.
