\mychapter{Solitude and Engagement}{Luang Por Pasanno}{May 2005}

With Luang Por Sumedho visiting, this last week has been a full one, 
with lots of contact and engagement. That's the nature of monastic 
life; even though there's an underlying foundation of simplicity, one 
goes through various phases of solitude and group activity. It's 
important to make a conscious effort to bring things back to a life of 
more solitude and less engagement. It's interesting to see how the mind 
picks up a particular way of relating and then rolls along with it. So 
we need to make that conscious effort to pull back.

It's not as if engagement is bad---it's been a wonderful and fruitful 
time with Luang Por Sumedho here. But I think it's time to bring the 
mind back in and ask how we can integrate his inspiring presence into 
our lives. How do we actually live with awakened attention? How do we 
put our day-to-day lives on the line and make them examples of clear 
knowing, clear seeing? This is what he's talking about. To hear these 
words and then carry on with a scattered, miserable existence doesn't 
really cut it. How can we keep recollecting and applying these 
teachings, particularly in the next couple of days? We do our chores, 
we do our duties, and we do what needs to be done. But we should also 
try to give ourselves more time for solitude and let the teachings of 
Luang Por take root in the heart.
