\mychapter{Centering on a Clear, Still Place}{Luang Por Pasanno}{June 
2005}

Having a sense of centering, whether we're doing chores or sitting in 
meditation, can be a valuable practice for us. It's essential that we 
remember to center ourselves---to bring things to a central place---so 
that we're working from a still point, rather than having our energy 
and attention diffused and scattered out into the world around us. As 
we collect ourselves at that center point, it brings our energy 
together, and we're able to see things clearly, without adding in our 
likes and dislikes. Centering in this way provides us with a reliable 
place from which to reflect upon the Dhamma, a place from which to 
apply the teachings in our day-to-day lives.
