\mychapter{Full Awakened Awareness}{Ajahn Amaro}{October 2006}

When there is full, awakened awareness, there is no identification with 
the body or with conditioned factors of mind. The realization of Dhamma 
is so complete that the life or death of the body is of as little 
consequence as the turning of the Earth is to the Sun. The body and 
mind are not-self, as is reiterated so often in the Buddhist 
scriptures, so the heart remains serene with all of life's ups and 
downs, its many psychological births and deaths, triumphs and failures, 
as well as the ``big death'' of the body's ending. As St.Â Theresa of 
Avila put it when expounding on this same theme, ``We die before we 
die, so that when we die, we don't die.''
