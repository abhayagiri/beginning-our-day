\mychapter{Directing Attention Skillfully}{Luang Por Pasanno}{April 
2005}

Learning how to meditate---how to develop the mind---is learning how to 
direct attention in a skillful way. Whatever we direct our attention 
toward becomes our reality. If we like, we can direct attention to all 
the chaos in the world or to the chaos of our own personal dramas. But 
we don't have to do that. We can instead direct our minds to 
contemplate our experiences as merely form, feeling, perception, mental 
formations, and consciousness. We can direct our attention in other 
skillful ways as well---toward objects that soothe the mind and conduce 
to peace and clarity. It's simple: We can incline the mind toward what 
is wholesome or what is troublesome. The choice we make is up to each 
one of us.
